    <h2>What is&nbsp;Vimwiki?</h2>
<p>From the <a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">official website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vimwiki is a personal wiki for Vim – interlinked, plain text files
written in a markup&nbsp;language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As this relies upon Vim&#8217;s power to write content in a simple format,
this quickly became a viable option to organize more and more&nbsp;notes!</p>
<hr>
<h2>What were the other options&nbsp;considered?</h2>
<p>I have used various approaches in the past for different purposes and
reasons, including <em>Evernote</em>, <em>Simplenote</em>, <em>Microsoft OneNote</em>,
<em>Google Docs</em>, <em>Boostnote</em>, <em>Freeplane</em>/<em>FreeMind</em> (mind-mapping),
<em>Workflowy</em> and even plain <code>.txt</code> files. Each has its pros and cons, but
I then decided to limit my options based on the following self-imposed&nbsp;requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has to be <strong>available on Linux</strong>. Right from the start, this would
disqualify many applications such as <em>Notational Velocity</em>, <em>Bear</em>,
<em>Quiver</em>, <em>Paper</em>, <em>Ulysses</em> and <em>Squid</em>.</li>
<li>It has to be <strong>open source</strong> as this is a philosophy that I strongly
embrace. Plus, having the ability to freely modify it and contribute to
the project is an important additional bonus. Adiós <em>Evernote</em>, <em>Google
Docs</em>, <em>Dropbox Paper</em>, <em>Microsoft OneNote</em>, <em>Workflowy</em> and <em>Quip</em>.</li>
<li>It has to be <strong>fast to use</strong> and it has to make it possible
to <strong>express oneself in more than one way</strong>. Say goodbye to
<em><a href="https://www.freeplane.org">Freeplane</a></em> (otherwise great for
general brainstorming!) and <em>FreeMind</em> (which has been abandoned
by its own developers): both are relatively slow on an old machine
because they use Java and it is quite a stretch to use them for
something other than mind maps. In that same category would disappear
<em><a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io</a></em>, which is fantastic for making
flowcharts and&nbsp;diagrams!</li>
<li>It has to be versatile enough to handle features such as <strong>including
images, links and attached files</strong> and have a way to perform <strong>search
and replace</strong>. Ciao <em><a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a></em> which
is, well, simple. Even though it doesn&#8217;t fit the bill in this case,
it remains a great option as it can synchronize your notes with many
different devices (iOS, MacOS, Android, Windows and Linux). It has
a feature that allows you to move a slider which acts as a timeline
and shows you a different version of your note since its creation
with the actual date and time down to the minute for each <em>restore
point</em>. You can also use tags and Markdown and it has options to
share and collaborate with others. Highly&nbsp;recommended!</li>
<li>It should have a hefty user base to back it up. This would exclude
text editor plugins such as <code>atom-notes</code> for <em>Atom</em> or <code>VSNotes</code> for <em><span class="caps">VS</span>
Code</em>, which also lack features for accomplishing all of the&nbsp;above.</li>
<li>On top of everything else, it has to be <strong>available offline</strong>, in a
<strong>portable and readable format</strong>. Now, after discarding most options, we
are left with <em>Boostnote</em> which uses CoffeeScript-Object-Notation and
<em>Vimwiki</em> which has its own Wiki syntax that&#8217;s similar in many ways to
Markdown*. Those are the strongest contenders that I could think of but
of course, if you would like to share your recommendations, please do so
in the comments&nbsp;below!</li>
</ul>
<p>* <sub>I somehow discredited
<strong><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs</a></strong> simply because I started
to learn Vim first and since I&#8217;m still far from understanding all of
its features, I had to postpone the discovery of Emacs.</sub></p>
<h3>One feature-rich alternative to&nbsp;Vimwiki</h3>
<p>After settling down on Vimwiki, I later found out about <a
href="https://joplin.cozic.net">Joplin</a>, which comes with many great
features and characteristics such&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Open&nbsp;Source</li>
<li>Manages notes and todo&nbsp;lists</li>
<li>Search across all&nbsp;notes/todos</li>
<li>Import/Export from/to various formats, including Markdown and even
imports from&nbsp;Evernote</li>
<li>Support for&nbsp;attachments</li>
<li>Tags</li>
<li>Synchronization with multiple providers such as Dropbox, Nextcloud,
OneDrive and even your own private&nbsp;cloud</li>
<li>Available for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and&nbsp;iOS</li>
<li>Web Clipper&nbsp;integration</li>
</ul>
<p>This application left me a great first impression to say the least and I
will make sure to stay up to date on its active development, which you
can <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin">follow on GitHub</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why did Vimwiki win in the&nbsp;end?</h2>
<h3>In&nbsp;short</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The modal nature of Vim makes it very hard to enjoy any other text
editor once you get used to it. The learning curve is quite considerable
and nearly infinite, but this is also why I think it is worth investing
more time to master it as it has proven to be an everlasting piece of
trusty&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>There is a feature in Boostnote to set the Editor Keymap to <code>vim</code> so
that you can edit text in a very similar way, but then you miss out on
Vim&#8217;s <code>Command mode</code> which adds tremendous extensibility and the ability
to create any mappings you wish on the&nbsp;fly.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4>Expanded&nbsp;edition</h4>
<p>Boostnote comes with nice features such as Tags, the ability to set
multiple storage locations for notes, a <code>Preferences</code> panel to adjust
many options, a feature to add code snippets, real-time preview of
Markdown being edited, etc. Make no mistake: this is a great program.
But there are many Vim features that are hard or impossible to replicate
and everything that you can do in Boostnote can be done in Vim also
(ctags, emmet syntax, plugins for Markdown,&nbsp;etc.).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For starters, the terminal integration is obviously unmatched. In
Vim, <code>CTRL+Z</code> will <em>stop</em> Vim and gives you access to the terminal to
do whatever you want to do. From that point, you can simply switch back
to Vim by issuing the command <code>fg</code>. The terminal integration goes even
further: you can have full access to the terminal inside Vim buffers
since Vim 8.1 and that is a feature that has been available in Neovim
for even&nbsp;longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though <code>vim</code> mode can be enabled to edit text, you have to use
the mouse to get many tasks done and the editing window can loose the
focus. On the other hand, Vim is just one single window by default that
you can split however you want, including adding tabs if your heart
tells you&nbsp;to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have to open your notes with Boostnote if you want them to be
fully readable out of the box. Vimwiki does almost no processing with
the content of the files so that it is very easy to open them with any
other text editor. On a related note, it is much easier to export many
notes at the same time with Vimwiki. Boostnote does have a few options
to export individual notes (<code>.md</code>, <code>.txt</code>, <code>.html</code> and print), but it is
not as user-friendly with many&nbsp;notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vimwiki makes it easy to link notes together and navigate between
them, even within subfolders: highlight text, press <code>Enter</code> to create a
link and open a new note, write your note and press <code>Backspace</code> to go
back to where you created the link. That&#8217;s quick and&nbsp;easy!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the end, it is a matter of taste as those programs are indeed very
distinct. Boostnote has a polished interface, is much easier to use and
has many settings easily changed. Vim/Neovim, on the contrary, requires
a lot of initial effort both to understand and to set up according
to your needs, but it does deliver a good dose of productivity&#8230;&nbsp;Eventually!</p>
<p>An honorable mention goes to Simplenote, which is a joy to use with
mobile devices and allows for quick synchronization between different
devices across all the supported&nbsp;platforms.</p>
<p>Where things really get in favor of Vim, you could mention the extensive
help system (command <code>:help</code>), the use of macros, words and lines
completion, the dot (<code>.</code>) command, the many registers at your disposal
for different tasks, the impressive amount of plugins available, the
ways in which you can configure mappings, functions&#8230; But that&#8217;s for a
whole new&nbsp;story!</p>
