## Terminals & Neovim

Terminal buffers are a built-in feature of `Neovim`. This means that
terminals can be launched inside Neovim just like any other buffer, may
it be a split window, a new tab or an independent buffer. Why is this so
useful? Be prepared to be amazed.

### Seamless integration with Vim commands

For a start, terminals are not just _opened_ inside Neovim: they are
truly integrated. When you type the letter `i` in a terminal buffer,
it switches to a new mode, `Terminal`, where you have access to all
underlying features of a regular Bash terminal, such as `CTRL + r`
to search, tab completion of commands, `CTRL + w` to delete a word
backwards or `CTRL + u` to delete the whole line backwards.

When you escape the `Terminal` mode, you switch back to `Normal` mode,
where all Vim commands are available as usual, such as navigation,
search, etc. Where this gets interesting is when you consider that the
terminal is just like any other buffer (except it's not _modifiable_)
and so you can for instance copy its content or paste into it from
different registers. You can split them, view the line number, get
automatic scrolling when output appears in `Insert` mode, you can switch
back to `Normal` mode at any time even if a command hasn't completed...
and of course all commands like `gt` to **g**o to another **t**ab work
as always.

### Terminals get supercharged with the power of Vim

This is getting exciting (at least for me). Now, having a terminal with
more power is useful in many cases:

-   A whole terminal session can be saved to another file easily by
    copying the desired range (`:%y` to copy everything, for example).

-   Instead of having to scroll with the mouse, all Vim commands are
    available to search and navigate through the buffer: `gg` to go to the
    beginning of the session, `G` to go to the end, `12G` to go to line
    number **12**, `/` or `?` to search forward and backward respectively.
    You can even set local or global marks to jump back and forth to precise
    lines consistently!

-   It's even possible to send commands directly to a specific
    terminal or set up a REPL to execute any code, either a
    selection, a line or a range of lines. I don't personally
    use that feature yet, but I see how useful that can be and
    you can too if you watch this [screencast presented by Drew
    Neil](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/neovim-sending-commands-to-a-
    terminal-buffer) on
    [thoughtbot.com](https://thoughtbot.com).

-   If the terminal is opened in `Normal` mode, the cursor and the current
    position are kept intact even though new output could appear, such as
    would be the case if you are running a server in the background or
    waiting for a system update to finish. This is especially nice for
    instance if you are trying to debug a web application: you can leave the
    cursor exactly where you would like to keep reading the output and never
    get lost... Plus you have the ability to easily move around, search and
    copy like a ninja!

### The workflow is more compact and centralized

Because the terminals are running with one Neovim instance, you get
everything in the same place, which is usually how you need to access
your work anyway. If for some reasons you need to have multiple
instances of Neovim running, this is possible too and in that situation
you could simply split them into different workspaces.

Because everything is launched with Neovim, every terminal left open
will also be exited when you close Neovim, shutting down any server
or quitting any background interaction going on in the terminals. I
have found that this behaviour is what I expect pretty much all the
time because the idea of having a terminal inside a working session
of Neovim is to work on something related, so it makes sense to close
everything that's to do with a single project or task when you exit the
text editor. No need for `CTRL + d` or `exit` anymore!

## Terminal settings to consider

I don't use many settings or mappings related to terminals, but I guess
the nicest one is to remap the `Escape` key because by default, this is
a weird mapping that leads to twisted fingers (`<C-\><C-n>`). Here is
what I currently have in my `init.vim` file (the equivalent of `.vimrc`
for Neovim):

```{.vim}
set termguicolors  " Make colors look better in terminal

" Exit from terminal buffer (Neovim) more easily (remaps Esc key in
" terminal)
tnoremap <C-[> <C-\><C-n>

" Open terminal buffer (M stands for the Alt key)
nnoremap <M-t> :te<CR>

" Switch to terminal buffer automatically (when only one terminal is
" open)
nnoremap <M-0> :b term://<CR>

" Move between windows exactly the same way as usual
tnoremap <C-j><C-k> <C-\><C-N>
tnoremap <C-h> <C-\><C-N><C-w>h
tnoremap <C-j> <C-\><C-N><C-w>j
tnoremap <C-k> <C-\><C-N><C-w>k
tnoremap <C-l> <C-\><C-N><C-w>l
```

## Conclusion

This was a quick overview of a feature that I have neglected for some
time but recently realized how well it integrates with my workflow. You
can find some more information by typing `:h terminal`. If you already
use Neovim, it's worth giving it a try! Otherwise, it's worth giving
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) a try.
