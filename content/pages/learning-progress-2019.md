> Learning is an eternal path. I wanted to share my own adventure

> to help me practice a technique that is known as [spaced
> repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).
> This is really just a summary to motivate myself to keep on track and
> be reminded as often as possible to stay a bit more humble, as it
> becomes obvious that I don't know much in the end. In the process, I
> hope you may find some inspiration too.
