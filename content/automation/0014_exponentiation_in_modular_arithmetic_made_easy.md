Summary: While playing around in the Python interpreter to validate answers to mathematical questions, I quickly found out that very large exponents are dealt with very inefficiently by default as they are simply evaluated as is. That's where Python came to its own rescue.

# Introduction

The following Python script will by no means provide any useful idea to
compete against the
[RSA algorithm](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>)
, but it does give you an idea of how
a simple technique about reducing the size of an exponent in modular
arithmetic can bring you closer to using much larger numbers than the
ones you could normally use in the Python interpreter.

# The script in action

```{.python}
"""Compute the result of a^b (mod k) by using the exponentiation technique.
The goal here is not efficiency, even though the program is actually pretty
fast: the algorithm is applied manually for demonstration purposes.
Testing on a modest Intel Core i5, having `a` and `b` each set to a random
number containing 2,000 digits and `k` set to a modulo of a number containing
20 digits, results are printed in about 3.3 seconds."""

    while True:

# Conclusion

It was very interesting to see how a technique that's applied manually
will work wonders with such large numbers. The Python interpreter can
barely calculate numbers with exponents with seven digits or more, while
a basic approach like the one shown above can quickly churn out the
results for seemingly quite large numbers.

As always, this code is
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/sglavoie/code-snippets/blob/main/python/mathematics/modular_arithmetic/exponentiation_mod_k.py).
