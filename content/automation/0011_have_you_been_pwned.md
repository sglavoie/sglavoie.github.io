# Introduction

[Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) has a very simple and
accessible API that's perfect to work with as a beginner. There are
different ways to retrieve information and the script below is only
one glimpse into the numerous possibilities available. It is built in
a way that makes it easy to add features and functionality thanks to
[Click](https://github.com/pallets/click), a wonderful _"command line
interface toolkit"_.

# Python to the rescue

The following script uses [Click](https://github.com/pallets/click)
to build a tiny command-line interface instead of more
traditional tools like `argparse`. You will also need
[requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) to peek inside the
API. Both can be obtained as follow in a terminal:

```{.bash}
$ pip install click requests
```

And now, the _pièce de résistance_.

```{.python}

Simple script that will take advantage of haveibeenpwned.com's API to
find out if your password has been breached.

# Conclusion

If you are familiar with Python,
you can easily make sense of how this little tool works by
reading its code. You can also have a look at this [repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/sglavoie/dev-helpers/tree/main/haveibeenpwnwed_password_checker) if you want
to fork it or reuse it any other way you wish. I have personally found
it much easier to work with [Click](https://github.com/pallets/click)
instead of `argparse` and `optparse`. I haven't got to try
[docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt) yet, but it is almost equally
as popular as Click on GitHub at the time of this writing and its
Pythonic way makes it another great option to consider.
