## What is Vimwiki?

From the [official website](https://vimwiki.github.io/):

> Vimwiki is a personal wiki for Vim – interlinked, plain text files
> written in a markup language.

As this relies upon Vim's power to write content in a simple format,
this quickly became a viable option to organize more and more notes!

---

## What were the other options considered?

I have used various approaches in the past for different purposes and
reasons, including _Evernote_, _Simplenote_, _Microsoft OneNote_,
_Google Docs_, _Boostnote_, _Freeplane_/_FreeMind_ (mind-mapping),
_Workflowy_ and even plain `.txt` files. Each has its pros and cons, but
I then decided to limit my options based on the following self-imposed
requirements:

-   It has to be **available on Linux**. Right from the start, this would
    disqualify many applications such as _Notational Velocity_, _Bear_,
    _Quiver_, _Paper_, _Ulysses_ and _Squid_.
-   It has to be **open source** as this is a philosophy that I strongly
    embrace. Plus, having the ability to freely modify it and contribute to
    the project is an important additional bonus. Adiós _Evernote_, _Google
    Docs_, _Dropbox Paper_, _Microsoft OneNote_, _Workflowy_ and _Quip_.
-   It has to be **fast to use** and it has to make it possible
    to **express oneself in more than one way**. Say goodbye to
    _[Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org)_ (otherwise great for
    general brainstorming!) and _FreeMind_ (which has been abandoned
    by its own developers): both are relatively slow on an old machine
    because they use Java and it is quite a stretch to use them for
    something other than mind maps. In that same category would disappear
    _[draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)_, which is fantastic for making
    flowcharts and diagrams!
-   It has to be versatile enough to handle features such as **including
    images, links and attached files** and have a way to perform **search
    and replace**. Ciao _[Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/)_ which
    is, well, simple. Even though it doesn't fit the bill in this case,
    it remains a great option as it can synchronize your notes with many
    different devices (iOS, macOS, Android, Windows and Linux). It has
    a feature that allows you to move a slider which acts as a timeline
    and shows you a different version of your note since its creation
    with the actual date and time down to the minute for each _restore
    point_. You can also use tags and Markdown and it has options to
    share and collaborate with others. Highly recommended!
-   It should have a hefty user base to back it up. This would exclude
    text editor plugins such as `atom-notes` for _Atom_ or `VSNotes` for _VS
    Code_, which also lack features for accomplishing all of the above.
-   On top of everything else, it has to be **available offline**, in a
    **portable and readable format**. Now, after discarding most options, we
    are left with _Boostnote_ which uses CoffeeScript-Object-Notation and
    _Vimwiki_ which has its own Wiki syntax that's similar in many ways to
    Markdown\*. Those are the strongest contenders that I could think of but
    of course, if you would like to share your recommendations, please do so
    in the comments below!

\* <sub>I somehow discredited
**[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs)** simply because I started
to learn Vim first and since I'm still far from understanding all of
its features, I had to postpone the discovery of Emacs.</sub>

### One feature-rich alternative to Vimwiki

After settling down on Vimwiki, I later found out about <a
href="https://joplin.cozic.net">Joplin</a>, which comes with many great
features and characteristics such as:

-   Free & Open Source
-   Manages notes and todo lists
-   Search across all notes/todos
-   Import/Export from/to various formats, including Markdown and even
    imports from Evernote
-   Support for attachments
-   Tags
-   Synchronization with multiple providers such as Dropbox, Nextcloud,
    OneDrive and even your own private cloud
-   Available for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS
-   Web Clipper integration

This application left me a great first impression to say the least and I
will make sure to stay up to date on its active development, which you
can <a href="https://github.com/laurent22/joplin">follow on GitHub</a>.

## Why did Vimwiki win in the end?

### In short

> The modal nature of Vim makes it very hard to enjoy any other text
> editor once you get used to it. The learning curve is quite considerable
> and nearly infinite, but this is also why I think it is worth investing
> more time to master it as it has proven to be an everlasting piece of
> trusty software.

> There is a feature in Boostnote to set the Editor Keymap to `vim` so
> that you can edit text in a very similar way, but then you miss out on
> Vim's `Command mode` which adds tremendous extensibility and the ability
> to create any mappings you wish on the fly.

#### Expanded edition

Boostnote comes with nice features such as Tags, the ability to set
multiple storage locations for notes, a `Preferences` panel to adjust
many options, a feature to add code snippets, real-time preview of
Markdown being edited, etc. Make no mistake: this is a great program.
But there are many Vim features that are hard or impossible to replicate
and everything that you can do in Boostnote can be done in Vim also
(ctags, emmet syntax, plugins for Markdown, etc.).

-   For starters, the terminal integration is obviously unmatched. In
    Vim, `CTRL+Z` will _stop_ Vim and gives you access to the terminal to
    do whatever you want to do. From that point, you can simply switch back
    to Vim by issuing the command `fg`. The terminal integration goes even
    further: you can have full access to the terminal inside Vim buffers
    since Vim 8.1 and that is a feature that has been available in Neovim
    for even longer.

-   Even though `vim` mode can be enabled to edit text, you have to use
    the mouse to get many tasks done and the editing window can loose the
    focus. On the other hand, Vim is just one single window by default that
    you can split however you want, including adding tabs if your heart
    tells you to.

-   You have to open your notes with Boostnote if you want them to be
    fully readable out of the box. Vimwiki does almost no processing with
    the content of the files so that it is very easy to open them with any
    other text editor. On a related note, it is much easier to export many
    notes at the same time with Vimwiki. Boostnote does have a few options
    to export individual notes (`.md`, `.txt`, `.html` and print), but it is
    not as user-friendly with many notes.

-   Vimwiki makes it easy to link notes together and navigate between
    them, even within subfolders: highlight text, press `Enter` to create a
    link and open a new note, write your note and press `Backspace` to go
    back to where you created the link. That's quick and easy!

## Conclusion

In the end, it is a matter of taste as those programs are indeed very
distinct. Boostnote has a polished interface, is much easier to use and
has many settings easily changed. Vim/Neovim, on the contrary, requires
a lot of initial effort both to understand and to set up according
to your needs, but it does deliver a good dose of productivity...
Eventually!

An honorable mention goes to Simplenote, which is a joy to use with
mobile devices and allows for quick synchronization between different
devices across all the supported platforms.

Where things really get in favor of Vim, you could mention the extensive
help system (command `:help`), the use of macros, words and lines
completion, the dot (`.`) command, the many registers at your disposal
for different tasks, the impressive amount of plugins available, the
ways in which you can configure mappings, functions... But that's for a
whole new story!
